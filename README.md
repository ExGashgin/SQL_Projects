- Exploratory analysis (identifying trends, aggregations, and key statistics)
- Data transformations (joins, subqueries, window functions)
- Optimized query structuring (indexing, query tuning)

Each project folder contains:
- Raw dataset (if applicable)
- SQL scripts (for data processing)
- Brief documentation explaining objectives and findings

***Technologies Used***

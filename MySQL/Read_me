Overview This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory analysis of a layoffs dataset using MySQL. The dataset includes company layoff records, and the project ensures data integrity before conducting trend analysis.

Dataset The dataset contains:

Company name
Location
Industry
Total laid-off employees
Percentage laid off
Date of layoffs
Stage of the company
Country
Funds raised
Data Cleaning To enhance data quality, the following steps were performed:

Removing duplicates using ROW_NUMBER().
Standardizing formats, such as trimming spaces, unifying industry names, and correctly formatting dates.
Handling missing values, replacing null values where possible, and filtering out incomplete records.
Dropping unnecessary columns to improve database structure.
Exploratory Analysis Once cleaned, several SQL queries were used to explore key layoff trends:

Highest layoffs (total and percentage-based).
Layoffs by industry, company, and location.
Yearly trends and rolling totals using window functions.
Monthly layoffs analysis for seasonality insights.
Top impacted companies and industries per year using DENSE_RANK().
Usage Clone this repository and run the SQL scripts in MySQL to replicate the analysis.
